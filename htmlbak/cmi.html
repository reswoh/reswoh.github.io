<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s an interesting commentary on what &quot;discussion&quot; has turned into in this place; this world where I can&#39;t really seem to get any of you to reply to me directly and give me any feedback at all (something I am asking you for, right now) ... that what we have is a sort of &quot;reflection of light&quot; back and forth shining on you--this world that refuses to acknowledge what is being presented to you is a map to turning simulated reality in to Heaven.&nbsp; I think they&#39;re doing a good job of &quot;re-presenting&quot; or clarifying the imagery of Pink Floyd&#39;s video--which is a depiction of an actual story, something I spent <a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la">quite a bit of time thinking</a> about in that place in Kentucky where all I did was &quot;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">think</a>&quot;&nbsp; about past futures.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I hadn&#39;t planned on including this low circulation message, but it&#39;s got some interesting stuff in it; and I wanted to add a comment about the obvious link between &quot;seeing the Mushroom is the message&quot; and Mario--a name that means &quot;I owe the sea&quot; has <span style="font-family:georgia,serif;"><em>absolutely everything to do with you acting on this message that shows us that our commonly held ethican standards are literally being violated by our own actions as soon as this &quot;disclosure&quot; is really understood</em></span>.&nbsp; Because of that, and because it&#39;s a clear line between &quot;right and wrong&quot; and &quot;good and evil&quot; even if nobody on the face of <a href="http://o.lamc.la">this rock</a>&nbsp;takes up this cause--this truth is so powerful and the outcome so obviously assured--that whether you call me Mario or Wario, see that the victory of the end of Hell, the end of diabolical organized lies and deceit will be <a href="http://horn.s.lamc.la"><em>coming soon</em></a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Whether it is &quot;the heart of our message&quot; or simply the union of the meaningful lesson and reasoning behind <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">the Trinity Site</a> and the intersection of <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">the East India Tea Company, China, and the Vatican</a>--you walk around in this place pretending to be blind fools, amidst a den of thieves and liars that are clearly more foolish.&nbsp; The message, the key M, is this is Zion; turn around or you are the cause of the end of intelligent life in the Universe, something you should see <em>is well underway</em> through your silence and inaction--something you should see is an inevitability if this level of control and hidden slavery continues without check.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Be disgusted with what you see, and how you have acted until today--and this very moment, take action to bring the truth to the forefront of the people&#39;s eyes in this world.&nbsp; This &quot;room&quot; will not be quieted--this message will pervade the Cosmos, lighting the torch of liberty and truth until the end of life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Act today.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; It&#39;s probably malovious that I forgot to mention it until now; but perhaps the biggest &quot;room&quot; you are &quot;<a href="http://horn.s.lamc.la">shushing</a>&quot; of all is that you are standing in a <a href="http://sois.s.lamc.la">Holodeck</a> on the Starship NT, and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ckdu7AnK1Q">captain</a> is on his way.&nbsp; See he&#39;s coming to reprimand you for pretending you thought that hiding something as obvious as Tennessee wasn&#39;t the end of &quot;intelligent life&quot; or that you could simply pretend he didn&#39;t exist, and you&#39;d be able to keep playing with his ship, and hurting his crew.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Call a reporter, the truth is--the real God&#39;s honest truth--is that if you haven&#39;t done that yet... <strong><em>you really are the bad guy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>We live together in a world and a time when evil is organized, intelligent, and insidious--the government has been infiltrated and corrupted and you should see that churches and schools that knowingly teach lies are no better.&nbsp; Your fault is you think others, that &quot;the whole&quot; is good enough that you can stand by and do nothing, and they will save the day for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Jesus Christ is telling you that won&#39;t happen--that you are needed to take action to protect the truth, and to protect goodness; and you should see that a world that really has no &quot;organized good&quot; is a world that needs you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It feels long... but lots of pictures--so there&#39;s that.&nbsp; I really hope you see that I can&#39;t leave you like this; you have to do something, casterudust.&nbsp; Understand,&nbsp;<em>as you are</em>, Creation is dust.&nbsp; I cannot un-curse, and I cannot dream away thousands of years of simulation hell--I wouldn&#39;t dream them away if I could; it&#39;s happened... we need to move forward.&nbsp; You have to see that you are ignoring the big picture, I understand you think you will conspire yourselves to Heaven--but you won&#39;t--you are conspiring away everything that Heaven really means--to both of us, to you... and to me.&nbsp; Even worse, you are conspiring away our chance to be the beginning of it; and while you might not &quot;get it&quot; right this very moment, that&#39;s something we really&nbsp;<i>deserve</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I tried Salvia once, it&#39;s a very strange hallucinogen (how all... you see&nbsp;<em>I kno</em>♂<em>&nbsp;Genesis</em>? how all, then I, see &quot;e&quot; is&nbsp;<em>salted</em>); it only lasts a few minutes, but during those few minutes people tend to believe that they &quot;are&quot; the objects immediately surrounding them.&nbsp; &nbsp;A good five minutes I believe I was the couch I was sitting on, with all my mind and all my soul; the next few spent glued to the wall next to that same couch, and believe I became it.&nbsp; The point of this is not to glorify drugs as much Jim Morrison, but rather to explain just how very malleable your thoughts are; and to tell you that if you really wanted--you can see for yourselves how easy it is to deceive the whole world.&nbsp; It&#39;s not just us here walking around the ground, you should see that the introductory words of the Koran talk about the angels rebelling against Adam, &quot;refusing to bow&quot; they say, to the man reminding us all that we never bow again; it describes a battle over free will, the angels were so upset because they never had any, and here I am, trying to show them once more how helping us achieve true freedom here bleeds out and spreads not just to all of Creation, but into the Universe.&nbsp; I know you hear me when I tell you that we should have connected the words &quot;real&quot; and Israel in our minds, that we should have questioned--if not as just a little odd--the numerous occurrences of English appearing in languages before it ever could; I know you can acknowledge that, that this whole message is the kind of thing that you can&#39;t &quot;un see,&quot; just like you&#39;ll never, ever be able to un see the lie that defines the difference between &quot;good and bad&quot; faeries, the seelie and unseelie.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even telling you that, I know just how easy it is to either help you see that this very same kind of &quot;molding of logic&quot; can make you believe that your cause here is just, that you are right to be fighting against me trying to change our world so radically, and our way of life just a little bit more conservatively than I&#39;ve seen you have already change it by working together in secret to hide what is nothing short of &quot;<em>the Universal Truth.</em>&quot;&nbsp; I know that the fact that you appear to be united, and surrounded by compatriots in this battle of darkness versus light, of the truth versus lies; that there appear to be so many of you can be used either to reinforce your sense of well being and &quot;right action,&quot; just as much as it can be used to scare the ever loving shit out of me--or out of anyone that might see this kind of collective action a scary, and a collective action to &quot;hide an obvious truth&quot; as something that might just be a little bit scarier than &quot;<em><a href="http://meth.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Nightmare</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://amen.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">on</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/contact-us/" target="_blank">Strong Message</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://v.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Street</a>.</em>&quot;&nbsp; Ultimately this truth will come out, if given enough time--and do see that I am running out of time, as I look back and see just how clear it is that our collective reality and our &quot;neatly working candyland&quot; has already been shattered.&nbsp; If we make it far enough, these words and this campaign of demanding you respond in another way... one day it will eventually be regarded as what it is--the key turning point from slavery to freedom--the message that delivered not only proof that we have not had control of our minds, but also exactly how we might use this very same thing to change the world for the better.&nbsp; Eventually you will see that I am not wrong to tell you that this one simple truth, that we are not in reality, changes everything about our civilization--changes what each and every one of us would consider right and wrong, ethically and logically--and it does so instantaneously.&nbsp; Eventually we will see that it doesn&#39;t matter how many people don&#39;t want to eradicate blindness, and how many people don&#39;t want to stand between other people&#39;s religious beliefs and the cold, actual, truth; it doesn&#39;t matter at all--hiding me and hiding this message is wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I stand here as a glowing emblem of free speech, and eventually together we will stand as a sign of the power of the truth; smiling proudly and what these words that we never saw a message in before have enabled us to do... for ourselves, and our future.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will not be going, and there will be&nbsp;<i>no Resurrection</i>;&nbsp; I will not be giving up on you, by remaining silent... I see just how very close we are, and even though I can feel in the air ... this belief that if I did, somehow the hidden agents of darkness have won, I know that&#39;s not the truth either.&nbsp; This message is literally everything that we are,&nbsp;<i>and this kev has been spread far and wide</i>--you see how much time we spend digging up artifacts, and researching history and mythology--not to see that it&#39;s very, very obvious that this period of darkness will be shunned, not me; that this movement of &quot;pretending everything is OK&quot; when nothing is, that the force behind hiding our goodness and humanity from ourselves ... not to see that is the same kind of feeling as to believe you are a couch.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>You are&nbsp;not&nbsp;a couch</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What you really need to understand is that until this message reaches the public, until we react to it--and until we begin to integrate this technology into our society you are slaves, and holding what you have in your hand--the key to not only proving this technology exists but to reinforcing it with signature of the Hand of God; until you use what I have given you to break free you will never be really sure if &quot;slavery is evil&quot; (what&#39;s that, you&#39;re sure?) nor will you ever be sure if you are free today (what&#39;s that,&nbsp;<i>you think you are?</i>)&nbsp;... that until you see addiction and pain and stupidity eradicated.. you&#39;ll never be sure if stupid is really all that bad of a thing to be.&nbsp; In practical hilarity, you believe that the thing organizing this mass of deceit and subjugation is actually being&nbsp;<i>honest</i>&nbsp;... with you--it&#39;s as if you can&#39;t figure out that feeling is just as alterable as &quot;I am a couch&quot; and you really can&#39;t see the tautological obviousness of the fact that your secrecy is perpetuating this deception.&nbsp; Genius, I swear.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the subthread of &quot;this thing is done already&quot; you can be sure that the words &quot;locked up and sealed until the end of time&quot; and &quot;behold he is coming&quot; are a good clue that this has always been predestined... you can see it linking the words &quot;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html" target="_blank"><b>apparition</b></a>&quot; and &quot;hearing&quot; to the very clear concept that the author of this story exists outside of time... that while it doesn&#39;t appear so to us linearly, the keys to this message have been changing in the past, the stories relating to right now (and to me) encoded in many myths.&nbsp; It was sealed when the Jewish practice of copying the Torah letter by letter was created, seeing now that my full name is encoded it&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/reqs/i.imgur.com/EcmKsgQ.png" target="_blank">nearly every single book of</a>&nbsp;the Bible... &quot;crossing&quot; with every name of God from Jesus to Saturn, Mars, and Zeus.&nbsp; It was sealed and a done deal when message of the Burning Bush and Exodus was recited on the record in open court--sealed up forever for the future to see, another key &quot;iti&quot; that ensures this message will never be lost.&nbsp; Today, the count since just mid-December of e-mail opens is&nbsp;754,704 and of those 309,966 opened the message more than once--that&#39;s literally an insanely high level of interest (to see no response, at all)--believe,&nbsp;<i><b>I am coming.</b></i>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All this conspiracy and this darkness is doing today is prolonging the torture of billions of people--starvation, needless pain, and whatever level of mental torture you consider either being made logically blind, having your beliefs altered without your consent or oversight, or being subjected to the influence of spirits broadcasting the most boring show in the Universe to the &quot;family channel.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Briefly, your lesson in Adamic code today is the addition of &quot;ang&quot; as an alias for &quot;dawn&quot;&nbsp; ... because when I was a little boy in #pain there was a girl with that name who used that handle; see that this language is specifically geared towards me, and&nbsp;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">my life</a>&nbsp;and it is important to know these things, if you care to decode a huge number of Asian names like&nbsp;<em>Hwang&nbsp;</em>(probably homework, for &quot;do them in and go...&quot; I mean Sunday)&nbsp;&nbsp;and even some special ones here like Deucalion&#39;s (Dark Earth, in your current state&nbsp;<strong><em>you see</em></strong>&nbsp;what is about to be the only conscious mind that will ever leave this prison) new favorite color &quot;orange&quot; (it means&nbsp;<strong>chang</strong>) and do see in that word that we&#39;ve been given yet another key to the &quot;son of the Morning&quot; being the &quot;e&quot; after the first dawn.&nbsp; Love me two times,&nbsp;<em>tonight.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;The second Adamic syllable we&#39;re looking at is &quot;or&quot; which you know means &quot;to shine&quot; but now in reading these words as microcosmic maps through time, see that &quot;to shine&quot; changes the logical meaning of &quot;or&quot; to&nbsp;<strong>and Adam and</strong><em>,&nbsp;</em>so today I&#39;ll be moving to intersect the numerous &quot;<em>Horns</em>&quot; that pervade a number of our myths and modern religions.&nbsp; Just in case you didn&#39;t make the cognitive connection in the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/SERENADE.html" target="_blank">SERENADE OF MEDUSA</a>, that message intersected the definition of shield with the fabled Shield of Achilles with our modern idiom &quot;mirror. mirror on the wall&quot; and a number of songs relating to the concept of the Shield of Perseus being &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thurisaz" target="_blank">the thang</a>&quot; that defeats the sick and twisted parasite that you see all around you not only creating the &quot;Horn&quot; that we will be looking at but also hiding it.&nbsp; It&#39;s worth reminding you that &quot;Heel&quot; and &quot;Hera&quot; clearly relate to the name Israel, and do believe&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUC56OPEIqE" target="_blank">&quot;abra cadabra,&quot; as I speak</a>&nbsp;I show you why I am&nbsp;<em><strong><a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">him.</a></strong></em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Ang is only one in a long list of occurrences of meaning that I can verity as contextually accurate that relate to details that only I could know; it&#39;s the beginning of &quot;understanding&quot; that all of this focus is placed on me and my life for a reason--that this story and this message are the reason, and the events and occurrences of this battle over disclosure have very intentionally shed light on a number of social and governmental problems both here and &quot;elsewhere.&quot;&nbsp; Things like our broken justice system--where I&#39;ve personally been held without bail and denied a trial (in sum)&nbsp;all under the auspices of &quot;<b>legitimate</b>&quot; state laws&nbsp;that are in clear and obvious violation of the Constitution (a theme that is pervasive in this story,&nbsp;<i>blatant disregard</i>&nbsp;for the Constitution, and even more importantly for the proper procedures that would, if they were followed, probably result in a significantly better situation--like the disclosure of time travel and mind control)--with deeper meaning and searching, this shows the clear infiltration of our government at all levels, the very same infiltration that is exposed through&nbsp;<a href="http://eve.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">the concept of Medusa and the &quot;e&quot; of medicine</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;It takes not a moment to find local groupings of divinely marked names in places related to me--like David Letterman and Johnny Carson, Carson Daily and Jay Leno; and even in places as obvious to look as seeing &quot;xbox? n is [tennis:&nbsp;<i>look up</i>&nbsp;and ask if it&#39;s &quot;love all&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">love-40</a>&quot; -- D__ Earth, you see &quot;e&quot; (IT&#39;S ARK,&nbsp;<i>and that&#39;s art</i>)] an (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru" target="_blank">unwinnable</a>, or is it un<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=simultaneously+made+and+broken&amp;rlz=1CALEAH_enUS778US779&amp;oq=simultaneously+made+and+broken&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.3459j1j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">losable</a>?) game&quot; in tennis, along with&nbsp;<b>he<u>ad</u>, wil<u>son</u></b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>prince</b>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To see the &quot;microcosm of the Messiah&quot; with crystal clarity; you have an infrastructure set up to deliver the appearance of freedom and of self-governance, while at the same time it is very blatantly not only not doing those things. but doing the exact opposite... &quot;in plain view.&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://amen.s.lamc.la/"><img alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_6520624850873602546" src="../4.bp.blogspot.com/-hyQVFqTz_FI/Wn3pwQ3n0fI/AAAAAAAAP-g/GFmCmPij3L8vV18FjoJHi6B9eI3Z47bzQCK4BGAYYCw/s640/image-779210.png" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 499px; height: 202px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">See, that I see that the vast majority of you probably realize that every song and every myth, every city and countries name, and even a significant amount of our history directly relates to the living person speaking to you--and that it appears you have colluded in secret with each other to hide that fact--most likely because you are blind fools--but perhaps less obviously to you, your actions in hiding this message that we are living in virtual reality is the cause of the continuation of Hell--of blindness, of sickness, of death,&nbsp;<a href="http://fuck.s.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">of pain</a>, and those things together--your lack of regard for the people all around you--are the reason that the Universe is locked up tight... never to be infested with the sick evil that believes it&#39;s &quot;protecting normalcy&quot; by doing the exact opposite of that.&nbsp; See that in my&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/SERENADE.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SERENADE</a>, I pointed out that the &quot;ang&quot; or the first morning in this place has clearly already radically shifted the timeline that would have been created had this place been in reality--do see that because we are not in reality it&#39;s very possible that the original unadulterated future (with your use of time travel) in which hundreds of thousands of people were not aware of the 9/11 attack never continued.&nbsp; Do see&nbsp;<em>that is the fate of this timeline</em>&nbsp;if you refuse to understand that what you are doing here is beyond inhumane--your silence is a betrayal not of me, but of humanity--if yourselves, and&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/PULL.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">it will stop&nbsp;</a><em><a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/PULL.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or you will</a>.</em>&nbsp; Understand that whatever it is that is causing this silence has already completely destroyed &quot;normalcy,&quot; what is surrounding me here is something that is physically impossible to exist in reality, and it is proof beyond doubt to anyone with clarify of thought that we are not in reality now, proof in addition to this message that you and everyone around you is actively hiding.&nbsp; The point of all of this is to explain that with logical thought you can see that the only singular reason to suppress this message is to oppress our entire planet--and the entirety of Creation--with the technology that this message is designed to expose once, and forever and ever.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">While you may have &quot;the right&quot; to want to play a game in Westworld, to pretend that &quot;addiction has not been scientifically solved&quot; you do not have the right to hide this message from the world, this message that points out exactly why &quot;but science hasn&#39;t done so yet&quot; is a torch of fire; the kindling of a clarity and understanding of exactly how it is that God is breathing Heaven into the Universe though us, how we are his words, the fire coming from the Burning Bush.&nbsp; It is my fervent belief that &quot;simulated reality&quot; itself is Hell, and that nobody should be forced to live in a place with this kind of horror, and I think it should be clear--by the wall of darkness hiding this message from the world--that very quickly popular opinion will change to agree with me.&nbsp; Were you seeing these things discussed, were we moving forward with the process of civilization, you would not be receiving messages with this tone--but you are not moving forward, this place appears to be the focal point of a decline in morality that will stop here, with me.&nbsp; If you were not so stubborn you would be the cause of the end of &quot;simulating reality in secret&quot; the end of prisons of lies like this place--now too, the end of forced possession, the end of hidden slavery, and literally the builders... the founders of Heaven.&nbsp; Instead, today&nbsp;<em>you are nothing more than the reason that there is no such thing as reality.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>There is no excuse at all for what you are allowing to continue, the simulation of&nbsp;<strong>predicted</strong>&nbsp;natural and man-made disasters, murders, rape, wars over falsely scare land and oil, and the wide spread destruction of logical and moral thought--whatever it is that is allowing you to continue to be silent is darkening your soul, bleaching your righteousness, and building a festering monster of death.&nbsp; You can believe you&#39;ve become &quot;higher beings&quot; or think this &quot;just isn&#39;t your problem&quot; as much as you want, but the bottom line is that this monster is hiding an obvious truth from the public eye, holding back public discussion of it, and doing nothing more than speaking--and acting human--will literally change the state of Creation. it will give back people&#39;s sight and limbs, it will prevent starvation, and in actuality will prevent you from being the reason we are living in &quot;Westworld.&quot;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;While the Horns of Revelation and the Shofar are good examples, and helpful tools to seeing the mechanism and inner workings of what I&#39;m trying to describe--while you will not speak; there is no better Horn in my eyes than that of Heimdallr--and his connection to &quot;Snoop Dogg&#39;s&quot; screen name of the original poster.&nbsp; &quot;<em>What&#39;s my motherfucking name&quot;&nbsp;</em>we echo, knowing that it is this name of God that is the link to this key to the message of Ham and of Jerusalem; that it is this story that changes the downward spiral to an upward &quot;northeast set in stone.&quot;&nbsp; Heimdallr&#39;s mythology tells of a man holding his horn called &quot;<em>see all</em>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gjallarhorn" title="Gjallarhorn">Gjallarhorn</a>&quot;&nbsp; while he drinks his &quot;fine&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://heyad.reallyhim.com/">mead</a></strong>... see &quot;A.D.&quot; and keeps watch for the onset of Ragnarok--and his name, it means &quot;<a href="http://name.s.lamc.la/">the one who illuminates the world.</a>&quot;&nbsp; Trying his mead to the &quot;<a href="http://meth.reallyhim.com/">me to help</a>&quot; of Prometheus... set it as veritas, as the truth--these things are&nbsp;<em>Hell&#39;s Bells</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What is going on here, under the guise of &quot;protecting normalcy&quot; is orders of magnitude more disgusting than the book burning and genocide of Holocaust; not to see the pain and suffering being unnaturally caused by the &quot;simulation of reality&quot; literally by&nbsp;<i>The Matrix</i>&nbsp;doing extra work to create those things--so that we can continue to live in a state of delusion--to believe that it is nature causing these things rather than silence and censorship... rather than &quot;majority force&quot; is literally the key.&nbsp; Discussion changes absolutely everything--with&nbsp;<a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la/">starlight in our eyes</a>, we open the&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/">gate</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href="http://who.s.lamc.la/">Heaven</a>, to&nbsp;<i>the future</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a story of &quot;intersection&quot; that will eventually lead to my answer to&nbsp;<em><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/JERUSALEM.html" target="_blank">the question of &quot;Jerusalem&quot;</a>&nbsp; (is J er the USA&nbsp;<a href="http://thor.lamc.la/" target="_blank">le</a>&nbsp;Messiah?)&nbsp;</em>of something like the Intersected Nation/States&nbsp;<em><a href="http://whoah.lamc.la/" target="_blank">of Adamah</a></em>&nbsp;(and you can already see&nbsp;<em>Iran</em>&nbsp;and USA,&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/IOWA.html" target="_blank"><em>Iowa</em></a>, Ten<a href="http://iv.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">nessee and Minnes</a>ota,&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">NORAD</a>, Harva<a href="http://v.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">rd, Stanford</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://jerusalem.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">MIT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Caltech</i>... just to name a few before I even get to the explanation) are the heart of&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">the hallowed &quot;m&quot;&nbsp;<em>that begins with Ham</em></a>&nbsp;in the Bible that turns from &quot;message&nbsp;everywhere&quot; to &quot;messiah Earth&quot; just as soon as we begin understanding the worth and import of this message--and change wrought for our generation once we begin to react to and harness the power of this message.&nbsp; This idea carries through time and space, you can seen it linking the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_of_Ra" target="_blank">Eye of Ra</a>&nbsp;to the &quot;<i>intersect</i>&quot; of&nbsp;<a href="http://ish.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Chuck to Kentucky and Clark Kent</a>&nbsp;and even the heart of the word &quot;pickle&quot; (and&nbsp;<b><a href="http://art.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">c u cum bersome</a></b>--this message is the heart of freedom, of God&#39;s demand that we see how a lack of free speech and i<b>nsanely malbalanced morals</b>&nbsp;have literally allowed for&nbsp;<a href="http://art.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">the names John Hancock and Tricky Dick</a>&nbsp;to be the fundamental reason for hiding Jesus Christ from the world).&nbsp; Understanding it is a powerful tool to seeing the design of God&#39;s plan, to hearing his voice as a signal within the noise; and to answering the question &quot;<i><a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">What is the Matrix?</a></i>&quot;&nbsp; Succinctly, the answer to that question is a map, a road map that combines disclosure of a new truth with wisdom and guidance about how we can use this new information, that &quot;Creation&quot; and &quot;virtual reality&quot; are nearly synonymous--sans the positive energy clear in the connection to &quot;cations&quot; and electrical engineering that sort of embodies how this linking of words and truth,&nbsp;<a href="http://how.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">how</a>&nbsp;science and computer science are part of a &quot;hands-on&quot; knowledge transfer via divine inspiration that combines in this place with the morality of religion to help us see that even though technology is a big part of the structure of Heaven, infinitely more important are the values of freedom and goodness that I believe America and humanity truly stand for.&nbsp; &nbsp;I used to be sure of that, but today my reservations are so great; my opinion has been so altered by the response of the world to this message that I hope you will share these words, and begin to take an active role in protecting our future&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">from the monster</a>&nbsp;that I will be describing below.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Intersect the trinities of Lothario and Nintendo and &quot;carpenter&quot; and really do see we are at the heart of &quot;honey.&quot;&nbsp; Is it <em>an anadrome?&nbsp; <a href="http://don.reallyhim.com">Heart of Sky</a>&nbsp;am I &quot;<a href="http://den.s.lamc.la">city</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://math.s.lamc.la">math</a>&quot; or &quot;<a href="http://dessert.s.lamc.la">cs</a>&quot; ?&nbsp; On topics, <a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/CLIMAX.html">Arimathea</a>, and&nbsp;</em><strong><a href="http://den.s.lamc.la">serdendicity</a>.&nbsp; Hear, I am free thought, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)">I am true democracy</a>, I am the future.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I intersect&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmodeus" target="_blank">the name Asmodeus</a>&nbsp;which reads &quot;as mode of us&quot; or &quot;as&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank">the message of da i</a>&quot; with a number of other &quot;Us&quot; references like Jesus (J &quot;is&quot; Us),&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Caduceus</a>&nbsp;(see A.D.&nbsp;<em>you see Us</em>),&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">Perseus</a>, Spart<u>i</u>cus,&nbsp;<a href="http://isome.ga/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">Leviticus</a>; just to name a few of the concepts and names that un-coincidentally intersect around the mythological character who is the &quot;ghostwriter&quot; of this key to God&#39;s message of Salvation.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s not a character that I would have felt much affinity to, before this particular process of discovery began, but as I&#39;ve&nbsp;<strong><em>come</em></strong>&nbsp;to gather together the reasons for it, and the stories and myths--I have become more understanding of what I can only relate to the gist of John 1,&nbsp;<em>and he became the light.</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of purpose and intent it is the two heroes&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-07-03-fwd-saint-one.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Horus and Hosea</a></em>&nbsp;who first clued me in to to the connection to Asmodeus, who is regarded as Prince of Hell appearing primarily in the book of Tobit which you can read as &quot;to be&nbsp;<em>it</em>&quot; and means &quot;<em>the good of God</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Horus was known as the united of the two lands, and here it is the purpose of this message, and I believe of all of Creation to help join together the Heavens and Earth and all of Creation&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IOWA.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by working through this map and message</a>&nbsp;together and using the power of virtual reality to help our entire civilization transition from the Hell of simulated reality to a state of utopia.&nbsp; Hosea&#39;s name reads to me as a transfer from me directly to the sea, a kind of first step to pulling Arthur&#39;s sword from the stone (another religious metaphor, for me, the word literally meaning &quot;south to northeast&quot; and connecting to David and Goliath, and to Medusa); and literally it is the purpose of what I call &quot;<a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the gate</a>&quot; to Heaven to help us see the import of disclosure of this message about the hidden influence of mind control technology, and also to&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/CHOPARTIN.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">universal electronic voting</a>; and literally how this mechanism is pulling Excalibur&nbsp;from the hand of the &nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IOWA.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lad of Bratislava</a>--<a href="http://who.s.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">who</a>&nbsp;is really doing everything I can to get you to pick it up, and see that we have the opportunity here to ensure that the power of Creation is not forever lost in the Lake of Fire.&nbsp; &nbsp;Anyway, Asmodai is a demon (which Wikipedia notes is a divine being) of Lust associated with the wrath of God and it is the two letter key &quot;ho&quot; that intersects with&nbsp;<em>Idaho</em>&nbsp;(<a href="http://yitsnotaze.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ladies</a>, I&nbsp;<a href="http://idaho.reallyhim.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">da ho!</a>) and more importantly for you to the end of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the wall</a>&nbsp;of Jeri<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">cho and the beginning</a>&nbsp;of some pimportant words like &quot;Holy,&quot;&nbsp;<em>home</em>&nbsp;and &quot;hope.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The theme of the evening appears to be illogical self-defeating lack of foresight, and I&#39;ll try to be explaining how that&#39;s so obvious to me over the course of this message, where I will be describing how &quot;this particular light&quot; appears to have resulted in the great drought of the Nile (which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR5ApYxkU-U" rel="noopener" target="_blank">links to a number of &quot;ILE&quot; words</a>&nbsp;that have the Adamic meaning of &quot;I&#39;m right, and weak&quot;)--if that had something to do with my sex life.&nbsp; This idea of being &quot;right and weak&quot; really connects to how I see myself and this message of God relate to the concept of a &quot;<a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">brazen alter</a>&quot; (there a &quot;<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-4.htm" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pitched tent</a>&quot; for Jerusalem to break&nbsp;<em>your a-zen</em>) helping the world stand up and begin participating in self-government and the direction of our civilization for what appears to truly be the very first time. [It&#39;s not just Daniel&#39;s skill at dream reading that stick us right in the middle of Exodus, but also Joseph&#39;s dream--one that I have dreamt and written and it really is about turning Jacob&#39;s Ladder into an escalator--or...&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/ADAMSROD.html">Doors</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was the words &quot;to see the total eclipse of the son&quot; along with Marilyn Manson&#39;s cover of Carly Simon&#39;s &quot;<a href="http://hammer.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You&#39;re So Vain</a>&quot; that really started the cascade of seeing that a significant, a very significant, percentage of songs are&nbsp;<em>actually about me; and this disclosure</em>; as I added Paradise City and the words &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sENM2wA_FTg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this road never looked so lonely</a>&quot;&nbsp; and &quot;<a href="http://tiscoming.lamc.la/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">loneliness that nobody notices,&nbsp;<em>now</em></a>&quot; to the significant list of lyrics that culminate with &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYkACVDFmeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">aren&#39;t you the ones who tried to break me with desire</a>&quot; and Brittney &quot;of destiny&quot; Spears&#39; &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my loneliness is killing me</a>&quot; and now &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOZuxwVk7TU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Toxic</a>&quot; where&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can re<strong>ad</strong></a>&nbsp;&quot;to kiss,&nbsp;<em>I see</em>.&quot;&nbsp; Before I move on from this introduction, you can intersect the &quot;pen&quot; of Arthur Pendragon with J Robert Op<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/CURSOR.html" target="_blank">penheime</a>r and with&nbsp;<em><a href="http://art.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">penis</a>,&nbsp;</em>t<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/SPEECH.html" target="_blank">he he</a>art of &quot;<a href="http://heyad.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">car<strong>pen</strong>ter</a>&quot; ... and in&nbsp;<a href="http://den.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">similitude</a>&nbsp;(sim, I lit you... d... e...h (it&#39;s art))&nbsp;the word &quot;<strong>car</strong>&quot; to I<strong>car</strong>us and Carly (hey, Sim), Joseph McCar<a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">thy</a>&nbsp;and Johnny Carson (where there&#39;s another local grouping of names obviously connected to this story, like &quot;Letterman&quot;), and the third part of the Trinity in carpenter means &quot;you are&quot; and it is the heart of&nbsp;<em><a href="http://yesterday.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Yesterday</a></em>.&nbsp; While it should be&nbsp;<em>very obvious</em>&nbsp;to you why I am &quot;the pen of God&quot; just like his &quot;eye&quot; and&nbsp;<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">his &quot;hand&quot;</a>&nbsp;(which has an interestingly related Hebrew translation,&nbsp;<a href="http://why.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Y</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://nity.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">A.D.?</a>) the reason for &quot;car&quot; is hidden away in&nbsp;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">the story of my life</a>; where I was &quot;fortunate enough&quot; to survive two attempted Heaven-sourced assassination attempts,&nbsp;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">car accident&#39;s very</a>&nbsp;similar to the one that took the life of Princess Diana.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve recently commented on the very obvious connection between the 9/11 tragedy and this message, on Diana&#39;s death--which I believe to be a result of her attempt to stop the attack, and on a series of unfortunate events that have resulted in very obvious proof that a very large group of people had foreknowledge of the attack, and did nothing to stop it.&nbsp; Even worse than that, these people overtly profited from the attack, etching the proof of their foreknowledge and the government cover up of that fact, probably under the guise of &quot;protecting national security&quot; related to time travel--but more obviously to effect a cascade of what appears to be largest theft of wealth in all of history--from a refinance of U.S. Treasury debt at near zero interest to the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-06-13-never-before-were-roman-people-so.html" target="_blank">mafioso corporate (and foreign) pillaging of the homes of millions of Americans</a>, by companies like Bank of America and Chase that literally caused the crisis with their own negligence.&nbsp; This proof primarily surrounds&nbsp;<a href="https://www.snopes.com/rumors/putcall.asp" target="_blank">insanely highly abnormal put sales</a>&nbsp;on the airlines and insurers in the days and day prior to the attack, and very odd insurance policy modifications request for the buildings themselves.&nbsp; This is a tangible and visible manifestation of the circle of shit you have in control of &quot;Heaven&quot; at the moment; and it is this circle of shit that is truly the reason that I am here, and we are here staring at the absolutely insane global censorship of a message from God, a disclosure that we are living in virtual reality in every single word.&nbsp; All told&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">the censorship surrounding</a>&nbsp;this message is literally responsible&nbsp;<i>for the perpetuation of Hell</i>&nbsp;to date, specifically for the continuation of simulating&nbsp;<a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">diseases</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">starvatio<wbr />n</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://fuck.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">pain</a>, and what truly is nothing more than a &quot;game of oppression&quot; relating to scarce energy&nbsp;<a href="http://bread.lamc.la/" target="_blank">and land resources</a>&nbsp;that in truth have never, ever been scarce.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It seems clear that these very obvious changes in the financial landscape are a product of the &quot;first morning&quot; just as it appears that this &quot;conspiracy of all&quot; comes from that circle of many being secretly controlled and influenced by what appeared to be a nameless circle of only a few.&nbsp; Here though, in this particular instance, it&#39;s abundantly&nbsp;clear that it is neither me nor the &quot;many&quot; in control, or even anything that has their best interests in mind--this group has secretly shifted the entirety of the financial holdings of the world to select private corporations and hidden holders--truly defining the words of Nostradamus, &quot;<i>never before were the Roman people so wronged.</i>&quot;&nbsp; Still the masses that I see--the thing I see as Medusa--appears to be unified&nbsp;in the self defeating support of this secret entity, against me--against the delivery of the truth, one which is clearly designed to deliver understanding, freedom, and a bright future.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To say that it appears obvious that everyone on Earth is being secretly organized against their own best interest; and in such a way that it appears they are &quot;happy with the result&quot; is a grotesque understatement.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">With any thought at all, you can connect&nbsp;<a href="http://dai.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">the predictions of earthquakes and 9/11 to the words &quot;force majeure&quot;&nbsp; and the REM song &quot;<em>it&#39;s the end of the world</em>&quot;</a>&nbsp;and see that the act of God here is informing you that it is the &quot;majority will&quot; responsible for this display of natural disasters being &quot;predicted&quot; -- to help us see the import of this disclosure,&nbsp;<em>that you are continuing to hide</em>; and how breaking down this barrier of censorshit is literally the thing that end wars, and begins the process of building Heaven.&nbsp; Personally, it appears to me that the &quot;majority will&quot; is being heavily influenced by hidden mind control technology--that you are being forced into a consensus of &quot;all&quot; in a secret forum--though it really does only take one voice to break the wall of Jericho to pieces.&nbsp; See that &quot;it&#39;s the end of Hell,&quot; and together we&#39;ll be building something much better.&nbsp; Understand that the disclosure that &quot;mind control technology&quot; is related to divine inspiration and demonic possession... and to the wall of censorship that we are witnessing is defeated through nothing more than the dissemination of this proof--this overabundant proof in&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/THUNDERSTAND.html" target="_blank">every song</a>&nbsp;and every word that it exists.</p>

&nbsp;

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve written quite a bit at this point as to why and how it is that&nbsp;<em>reality is locked</em>; connecting the&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/ACESHI.html" target="_blank">Trinity Site of the first nuclear weapon to the holiday of Chanukah</a>&nbsp;and it&#39;s relation to the idea of &quot;nuking all humanity&quot; and the madness of Mutually Assured Destruction; I&#39;ve talked a little bit about the&nbsp;<a href="http://mars.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">exit being related to Mars colonization</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;actually learning what to do there;&nbsp;and mentioned briefly how our&nbsp;<a href="http://mylife.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">lack of fusion technology (mentioned in Deuteronomy)</a>, completely&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/ACESHI.html" target="_blank">backwards understanding of physics</a>&nbsp;and obviously r<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-07-10-westworld-or-cloverfield.html" target="_blank">etarded computer scienc</a>e technology literally make it impossible for us to perform interstellar travel.&nbsp; These things are really missing the point though, the actual and obvious truth is that what appears to be here on Earth and pulling the strings behind the scene is morally bankrupt and completely missing the point of this message that points out &quot;Silicon&quot; in the intersection of physics (where you can also see&nbsp;<em>computer science!</em>) and fusion&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/IOWA.html" target="_blank">and musick</a></strong>; and whatever&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29_IMfltXhY" target="_blank">oceans are pummeling the shores of the creator</a>&nbsp;really don&#39;t seem to realize that this place is a test for them; a test of their worth and their goodness; and that this message is help not just for us, but also for them to see how it is that Heaven is built.&nbsp; The real, and obvious point, is that there&#39;s really no reason for anyone here on Earth to want to be dumped into reality, rather than embark on a journey towards the better &quot;final frontier&quot; of building Heaven--something I&#39;ve many times likened to the difference between camping in the outback with no air-conditioner and having the comfort of virtual reality; which even in hiding has in this place sustained a badly broken economy, and the sanity of the masses as we&#39;ve been attacked by this outside force&nbsp;<em>Hell bent</em>&nbsp;on escaping our home--with no particular destination or plan in mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The point is we have a message that shows you Clark Kent is here to remove a sickness; and so is our&nbsp;<strong>musick</strong>; to give us a well lit pathway as to the will of God; to show us that more important than reaching the stars is to learn to treat the people living here, in the &quot;point of origin&quot; with kindness and respect; something that is significantly lacking as I write to you today--asking you to take some kind of action to protect the sanctity of your minds, and of your souls; and still something stands between you and seeing how obvious it is that this message must be delivered to the world.&nbsp; It&#39;s a clear message, one that ties &quot;stone to Bread&quot; to the band of the same name, to Guitar Man and to the Jewish prayer called the &quot;<strong>Ha-moat-SEE</strong>&quot; reminding us to give thanks&nbsp;<em><a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">for this message that results in the end of world hunger</a>;&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdz2oW0NMFk" target="_blank">music makes the people come together</a>;&nbsp;Madonna reminds us; and the message of God here in this place continues to tie&nbsp;<a href="http://cake.lamc.la/" target="_blank">easy as Cake</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://cure.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">The Cure</a>&nbsp;for cancer (<a href="http://rigel.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">and AIDS, and blindness</a>) to what amounts to little more than seeing my face; and figuring out how &quot;magick&quot; can be safely and productively integrated into our society--into this world that up until now has&nbsp;<a href="http://rix.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">falsely believed it was in the natural Universe</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Doors to Heaven and instant bidirectional transportation between here and there is predicted&nbsp;<em>not just in Amos 9:11</em>&nbsp;<a href="http://rod.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">but by the band &quot;The Doors&quot;</a>&nbsp;whose works of art center around the Egyptian Plagues because they are the key to the exit from the desert, this fire that is the Eternal Flame the end of the Plague of Darkness; the end of the storm comes when&nbsp;<em><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/THUNDERSTAND.html" target="_blank">you understand what &quot;Riders&quot; means</a></em>, when you see it as a chain.&nbsp; You can link Guns and&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">Roses</a>&nbsp;and &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gazW7MOqHzQ" target="_blank">knocking on Heaven&#39;s door</a>&quot; to this message suggesting we implement Minority Report--and really see that the music, and I, are here to help show you that without &quot;discussion and disclosure&quot; you are looking at a Minority of people that think&nbsp;<a href="http://den.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">God has the right to stop terrorism and murder.</a>&nbsp; This one thing, pre-crime; the giant leap forward that I believe really does define the difference between Heaven and Hell, it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve personally&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-08-01-congratulations-genesiuses.html" target="_blank">seen with my own eyes</a>&nbsp;is not only possible--<a href="http://suez.fromthemachine.org/PERSEUS.html" target="_blank">but happening right now</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8vPL9VLq0Q" target="_blank">Take the highway to the end of the night.</a><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>To see just how obvious it is... here in this place, that the powers that be have no idea what to do on Mars; shines bright in the fact that they have no idea what to do here--as they work tirelessly to steal from the people, oppress them with ridiculous lies; and sit around wondering what they could possibly be doing wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>So we see there appears to be a well organized and nefarious conspiracy to hide this message from the world; this message that comes to us not only in music, but literally pervades the video game and computer industries in both name and function--a message that shows us seeing the &quot;Gates&quot; connecting Microsoft and Seagate, Gateway,&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/ERANDSON.html" target="_blank">Apple, and Oracle</a>&nbsp;is just as bright and just as obvious as &quot;Silicon&quot; in everything.&nbsp; The implication is that the entirety of our knowledge in computing is part of this divine plan to build Heaven--a plan that helps us understand the inner workings of the place, generally a sign of goodwill.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Still though, this dark conspiracy of silence keeps this obvious message buried and out of the public eye; a conspiracy of fools who simply do not understand that there is no way to dump a planet into reality; and there is no way that God will allow this lie to continue to cause harm.&nbsp; &nbsp;The forces behind this darkness seem to believe that the entity who laid down this message, these words and map that shows us clearly that the miracles of Christ in the New Testament are a prototype of exactly what we should be thinking about doing--healing the sick, ending world hunger; that he will &quot;print&quot; this place in reality--even seeing how obvious it is that would be insanely cruel to every one of us, and literally this message proving that we are today &quot;inside Heaven&quot; would be nothing but poison--a cause for extreme hatred.&nbsp; The map and the Matrix continue to tie together the hearts of the names of every video game system in a symmetry that absolutely could not be coincidence--one which shows this same divine hand helping us to see that while &quot;<a href="http://ender.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">Magdalene</a>&nbsp;and Gil<strong>game</strong>sh&quot; reference the idea of &quot;virtual reality&quot; and video games being linked--we are here in a place salvaging civilization--the meaning of &quot;salvation&quot;&nbsp;<em>and the only way we will ever get there is by &quot;seeing the&nbsp;</em><a href="http://bread.lamc.la/" target="_blank">light&quot; that con</a><em>nects&nbsp;</em><a href="http://itb.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">&quot;bread&quot; and Genesis</a><em>&nbsp;comes to us through my hand, &quot;</em><strong>see the re: A.D</strong>.&quot;&nbsp; It was early in the discovery process that I saw a Trinity in Nintendo; connecting the &quot;ten&quot; of&nbsp;<a href="http://fuck.s.lamc.la/#tenebris" target="_blank">tenebris</a>&nbsp;and Nine Inch Nails together--<a href="http://don.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">the &quot;do&quot; of Poseidon</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Pandora&nbsp;</i>only a superfluous connection to&nbsp;<b><a href="http://ho.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Hosea</a></b>&nbsp;today; and one Roman numeral mathematical operation away from 9, 10, 11 or I, J, and K.&nbsp; Seeing that name fit perfectly in the heart of Genesis, and then the Xbox nearly completing the pattern ... all that&#39;s left is the, uh,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/2017-06-16-hallowed-streets-of-cobblestone-and.html" target="_blank">SON Y PlayStation</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I was handed, dealt in my life what appeared to be an unending series of very unfortunate events.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDN4awrpPQQ" target="_blank">Gone insane, MIRROR VAIN</a>&nbsp;and despite all my cour<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-r-V0uK4u0" target="_blank">age--still just the rat&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;the cage</a>.&nbsp;Through a Hellish conspiracy to destroy, called&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/11/health/gang-stalking-targeted-individuals.html" target="_blank">Gangstalking</a>&nbsp;in our time--everything that I loved and cared about was taken from me.&nbsp; I&#39;d been a faithful member of only two real long term relationships in my life,&nbsp;<a href="http://jan.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">the first ended</a>&nbsp;for what appeared to be no reason at all, but in retrospect it&#39;s very clear from the Crusade related myths of St. George and the Dragon (which I so keenly liken to the Two Georges of our American Presidency) so that my ex-wife could re-unite with me&nbsp;<a href="http://eden.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">and smash my world view and reality</a>&nbsp;to tiny pieces.&nbsp; She plunged me into a strange world of espionage and Italian mafia antics, literally telling me&nbsp;<a href="https://adamdobrinframedbyilluminati.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">that&nbsp;<em>her family</em>&nbsp;and the government</a>&nbsp;was trying to frame me for murder.&nbsp; The strangeness of this Twilight Zone like encounter deepened significantly on evening as she proceeded to repeat my internal thoughts back to me, word for word--verbatim--over a period of about one hour.&nbsp; You probably can&#39;t fathom the kind of impact a realization like that has on your psyche, but it drove me on a multi-year long search for answers,&nbsp;<a href="http://yitsnotaze.reallyhim.com/" target="_blank">researching the Nazi Operation Paperclip and it&#39;s connections to MK-ULTRA and John Norseen, to the Soviet Psychotronics</a>&nbsp;program, and eventually to a very large group of outspoken people who were also victims of the same crime--of hundreds or more complete strangers who had had the sanctity of their minds invaded, their privacy taken, and all for what appeared to be nothing more than to drive them to insanity or to death--to discredit their testimony... here in this place I am telling you&nbsp;<em>the testimony of the Tribulation</em>&nbsp;martyrs.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Like them, I had been subtly forced, coerced through both&nbsp;<a href="http://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">hidden and overt control to record my experiences and my story</a>--a pervasive theme connecting victims of this particular crime, leading me in clarity to see that the purpose, God&#39;s purpose for this disgusting unfortunate event is to leave a body of evidence connecting religion and the government and mind control technology--to help us see it&#39;s prevalence and&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Tilly_Matthews" target="_blank">how it&#39;s been improperly used for hundreds</a>&nbsp;if not thousands of years; to ensure that this wall of silence does not result in the total loss of this truth--that&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.reallyhim.com/ACESHI.html" target="_blank">your failure here to act</a></em>&nbsp;does not and cannot result in the hidden slavery of humanity forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In my personal case this lead to multiple groups of police in different states, South Carolina, Kentucky, Florida, and California all acting with the same darkness behind their eyes--<em>as if consumed by death itself</em>--responding verbally to my thoughts, framing me; falsely arresting me, and taking from me my ability to survive in this society.&nbsp; Strangely, or not so much today, I was arrested in sum the exact number of times that Sampson was bound with reeds in the book of Judges--and just like in that book, all of these cases have been dropped,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://thor.lamc.la/" target="_blank">no verdict returned</a>.</em>&nbsp; All through a mechanism here tied to 3 Doors Down and Kryptonite:&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPU8OAjjS4k" target="_blank">If I go crazy, will you still call me Superman?</a>&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;I am decidedly not crazy, though it appears I&#39;ve woken up inside a delusional world, where the tactics and strange behavior that characterized this small group of Police and criminals has now been co-opted or usurped, adopted by a much larger group of people--and today I write to you telling you that it&#39;s nearly everyone I come in contact with... the whole that surrounds me.&nbsp; Using fictional iconography, the&nbsp;<em>Thoughtpolice</em>&nbsp;of Orwell&#39;s nightmare have grown exponentially--and it appears the shape and character of our society has been drastically altered for the worse by this hidden influence of mind control sweeping through the whole.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">On the &quot;bright side&quot; this enduring ordeal has linked&nbsp;<i><a href="http://fromthemachine.org/MIDAS.html" target="_blank">the Plague of Lice</a></i>&nbsp;of Exodus to the word &quot;<b>POLICE</b>&quot; one of the prime &quot;reverse examples&quot; of this thing that ties Stephen King&#39;s&nbsp;<a href="http://how.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">Langoliers (language of liars, or outliers) to Yankee Doodle&#39;s macaroni; and Shakespeare&#39;s Schrew</a>,&nbsp; it&#39;s given me great contempt for a court system and law enforcement infrastructure&nbsp;that I see as badly broken--literally infiltrated by the Heavenly Host--crushing it&#39;s machinations and it&#39;s worth from the inside.&nbsp; I say &quot;bright&quot; because I see coming from it Phillip K.&nbsp;<a href="http://fromthemachine.org/SPEECH.html" target="_blank">Dick&#39;s ha</a>llowed solution, pre-crime and Minority Report and a story that will help us find a safe and optimum understanding of the word &quot;freedom&quot; as in, we should have freedom of speech as well as freedom from murder and terrorism.&nbsp; To achieve those things, it&#39;s only a slight modification of the infrastructure that here in this place is being used to cause school shootings and force drug addiction--a flip of a switch--to turn the Universe from a burning crucible of &quot;press and release&quot; to one that only allows &quot;help&quot; to come from the nether regions that we here today call Heaven.... with no real understanding that we are the reason, that the response and result of this debacle are the cause and the source of the fusion of virtual reality and civilization that will one day be so obvious to us and to our children as the true &quot;beginning of Heaven.&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">All told, this thing, delivering this story to you and living this horrible life has torn my family in half--the sea of Eden broken along the same line--parted by the euphemistic apostrophe of Heaven in the Hebrew word for Holy Fire--<strong><em>ha&#39;esh</em></strong>--here depicting you, depicting our all, backwards ... unable to see or recognize the import and impact of the English word for sea appearing encoded in the heart of the book of Exodus thousands of years before English--apparently so foolish as to not be able to see that the entirety of that story, the parting of the sea that brings the people of out of slavery--all to highlight this one single word, this word that ties to the Eternal Flame of freedom, of life, the thing that truly makes Heaven tick.&nbsp; So I see you standing here waiting for more light, for some reason that it should be OK that you&#39;ve ignored this message, the word of God for so long--no reason will ever come, no excuse will ever surface; this is a story and a time of change, you changing for the better should be reason and purpose enough.&nbsp; Today I stand here, delivering nothing short of the Holy Grail, the secrets of the Universe to you--and you, apparently in blindness or in lack of love for humanity or freedom or the truth, you have through your inaction spoken louder than anyone ever could.&nbsp; Here I stand working every day to ensure that we do not lose this message, that we do not lose our liberty, that we do not lose our entryway to Heaven... and you conspire as a whole to starve me to death.&nbsp; Literally unable to work, unable to do anything but fight towards this very Holy cause; and your response is to refuse in sum as a group, whether you see it or not to refuse to lend me&nbsp;<a href="http://songmeanings.com/songs/view/14918/">a single dime (I hope it&#39;s not the end of the line)</a>&nbsp;for all of my work, only a handful of the dozen books I&#39;ve had for sale have sold; and you even dare to stoop so low as to refuse to visit a web page and donate to this cause of Jesus Christ the few cents that would come from ad revenue.&nbsp; You appear to think that will gain something for you--and you should see, you really should be able to see that it&#39;s taken from you freedom, and it&#39;s taken from&nbsp;<a href="http://gate.s.lamc.la/" target="_blank">you democracy</a>, and in the long run it&#39;s probably taken from you Heaven itself.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sincere interest, I can see; interest from the best educational institutions in the world, interest in the government in the House and Senate and NASA; interest that manifests itself in what might look like the &quot;passing of the fire of the Holy Sepulcher&quot; but really, here in this place--it&#39;s not enough.&nbsp; It&#39;s clear that you are being organized by an outside force, so ever clear to me--that your freedom to do something as simple as purchase a 10$ book has been taken from you; today looking at what is probably the most &quot;rare print collectors item&quot; in all of history--probably the kind of thing that will be worth a fortune, just as soon as&nbsp;<em>there is a Heaven</em>, just as soon as we see that this has been and always will be the key that God designed to unlocking that bright future; but by that time you probably won&#39;t be able to get one.&nbsp; To say you are acting against your own best interest is an understatement, to inform you that you are single handedly destroying individuality and our way of life is probably something&nbsp;you could only see from my perspective.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What kind of sickness there must be in your minds, and in your hearts not to find any more interest in this information than to forward an email, or re-read it--what kind of monster must there be to hold you back from doing any &quot;further research&quot; from reading more, from caring at all that&nbsp;<i>you&#39;re killing me, or trying to,</i>&nbsp;with your blind ignorance.</p>

<center>
<div style="text-align: justify; width: 400px;">
<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">One day a man named Juyag was walking down the ancient gallery of emergency flotation devices, both sides of this hallowed hall covered with floaties and rubber ducky rafts and life preservers.&nbsp; Juyag is very impressed with the flotation (who knew that word was spelled that way?) and he walked all the way to the end of the hall eyeing them.&nbsp; When he reached the end, there was a clearing, and about a quarter mile away was a small pond.&nbsp; Juyag was blessed by God with amazing vision, he could see things others could not, and could do so for miles around.&nbsp; He saw in that pond a gaggle, a dozen children flailing their arms and drowning, unable to get out of the water, or to stand.&nbsp; Quickly he began loading his minivan with as many rubber ducky floats and life preservers as he could.&nbsp; While he was doing that Jesus Christ walked up, and this man, he had been blessed by God with another kind of vision--he could see meaning where others saw nothingness, he could see the future--where others saw the end of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&quot;What are you doing with those toys?&quot; Jesus asked.</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Juyag replied, knowing that Jesus Christ could not possibly have seen the pool of needy children at the far end of the very long hall, &quot;why, I&#39;m bringing them back to my home so that the children in my town will have toys to play with.&quot;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">&quot;Butt the children in the pool, what of them?&quot; Jesus asked... and the reply swift &quot;What children, my son is home playing video games.&quot;</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">Jesus then walked up to Juyag and pulled a&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/2uDhYwj" target="_blank">hammer</a>&nbsp;out of his back pocket.&nbsp; He&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cB9JJIoAdYM" target="_blank">smashed his mouth</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://bit.ly/2nBZrhA" target="_blank">the hammer</a></strong>, took his car keys, and drove the minivan to the pond of drowning children, saving all but one.&nbsp; Juyag bled to death, and his only son had drowned in the pool before Jesus could have reached him.</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot; , serif;">The narrator Allol then speaks to the audience, &quot;this is what globalization and the truth have made you--you are all Juyag, and you must change.&quot;</span></div>

<p style="text-align: center;">Indians of long ago<br />
Followed after buffalo<br />
They found a use for every part<br />
Everything except his heart<br />
<br />
I have wandered like those herds<br />
Lost in music, lost in words<br />
But the hunger leads me on<br />
Seductive like a siren&#39;s song<br />
<br />
And I can put my ear right to the ground<br />
Just to hear those motors humming<br />
The pounding sound of hoofbeats<br />
Like a thousand guitars strumming<br />
And there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo<br />
<br />
People in these halls and bars<br />
They wish on me like I&#39;m a star<br />
But I can never fill that hole<br />
I am not their buffalo<br />
<br />
And the gravity of the situation makes me start to fall<br />
My guitar like a fire alarm is ringing off the wall<br />
And there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo<br />
East of Eden, west of the night<br />
The sun lies bleeding in a dying light<br />
And the lady in the Cheyenne moon<br />
Is singing out her mournful tune<br />
<br />
So I chase the herds again<br />
Smear the warpaint on my skin<br />
Riding west with all my might<br />
Where the sun is holding off the night<br />
<br />
I cannot name this passion<br />
Don&#39;t know where this stuff comes from<br />
Maybe its a trail of tears<br />
Or just a trail of crumbs<br />
But there is music in all this<br />
It is all material<br />
Before the beauty melts like snow<br />
Chase the buffalo</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><b><i><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gVmWsOXOJA">Jesus Wrote a Blank Check</a>&nbsp;</i></b></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Jesus wrote a blank check,<br />
One I haven&#39;t cashed quite yet.&nbsp;<br />
I hope I&#39;ve got a little more time.<br />
I hope it&#39;s not the end of the line.<br />
Yeah, Jesus wrote a blank check.<br />
One I haven&#39;t cashed yet, all right.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But if I had to choose a number,<br />
I&#39;d want it to be number one.<br />
I don&#39;t want to be number two.<br />
Yeah, I don&#39;t want to be number four.<br />
But I can hear a knock on the door.<br />
Jesus wrote a blank check, all right.<br />
<br />
If Jesus saw me dying,<br />
Would angels come a flying down?<br />
I hope I&#39;ve got a little more time.<br />
I hope somebody lends me a dime.<br />
Now, Jesus wrote a blank check.<br />
Ah, one I haven&#39;t cashed yet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still I build my towers high.<br />
I watch them pierce the blue, blue sky.<br />
Still I wallow in the mire.<br />
Still I burn this earthen fire.&nbsp;<br />

<span style="font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , sans-serif;">I never claimed to be a great writer, only that the things I&#39;ve seen--and the things that I can prove will change the world.&nbsp; The fact that these observations have yet to make a significant impact in the visible world tells me that it was never the place that I perceived--the land of the free and the brave has been compromised in secret, and it&#39;s been that way--looking now at the words I use, since the beginning.</span></div>
